## What we made
An original 30 second musical piece created entirely in **Audacity** using the **sampling** technique. We combined at least three audio samples from **freesound.org**, transformed them (kinda) (trim, time-stretch, pitch-shift, EQ, reverb), and arranged them
## Why we made it this way (justification)
- **Sampling** enables rapid prototyping of musical ideas and teaches editing/transformation skills (cut, fade, crossfade, normalize)
- **Three+ sources** encourage diversity of timbres and avoid overreliance on a single loop.


## Tools & project settings
- **DAW**: Audacity (macOS)
- **Project Rate**: 44100 Hz (bottom-left in Audacity)
- **Bit depth**: 16-bit (defaults are fine)
- **BPM (guide/click)**: 120 BPM (via `Generate → Rhythm Track`), 4/4 time
